## Rules

**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters.

Online game rules:
1. Select the category of question.
2. Try to answer the question letter-by-letter (you are able to use keyboard buttons or mouse button clicks).
3. In case of 6 failed attempts - the game is over (Man will be hung).

Good luck!
